## ARIA

### Rules

1. Use semantic HTML elements and don't override their default HTML roles by using [ARIA roles](#roles).
1. No ARIA is better than bad ARIA.
1. Always support keyboard navigation. You can add `tabindex= "0"` to any element that needs a focus but doesn't normally receive keyboard focus. Avoid using `tabindex` > 0 to prevent potential keyboard focus order issues.

   ```html
   <span role="button" tabindex="0">Submit</span>
   <!-- Don't do this -->
   <span role="button" tabindex="1">Submit</span>
   ```

1. [Don't hide focusable elements](#aria)
   Thay link tới #aria thành "hide an element and make it avaiable only for screen readers"

### Roles

_Roles_ define what an element is or does on the page or app.

```html
<!-- This should be a <button> -->
<div role="button">Read more</div>
```

### States

_States_ define the current condition or data values associated with the element.

```html
<div aria-disabled="true">Read more</div>
```

### Properties

_Properties_ define the characteristics or relationships to an object.

```html
<button aria-label="Read more about us">Read More</button>
```
