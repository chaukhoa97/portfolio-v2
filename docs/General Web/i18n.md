## Search Engine Optimization

- Use the `lang` attribute on the `<html>` tag.
- Include the locale in the URL (e.g en_US, zh_CN, etc).
- Webpages should use sth like `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="de" href="http://de.example.com/page.html" />` to tell search engines that there is another page at the specified `href` with the same content but for another language/ locale.

## Locale vs Language

- **Locale** control how numbers, dates, and times display for your region: which may be a country, a portion of country or may not even honor country boundaries.
- **Language** can be different between locales e.g. `en_US` & `en_GB`.

## Predict locale but don't restrict

Servers can determine the locale/ language of visitors via a combination of HTTP `Accept-Language` header and IP. However, predictions are not foolproof (especially if visitors are using VPNs) and visitors should still be allowed to change their country/language easily without hassle.
