# Before you read

## What are these docs about?

When I was first starting to learn programming, I used to note all my should-remember things in one of my repositories, sometimes in documents or anything that can be written on.

As my coding journey goes on they have started to become unmanageable and it messes up when I try to find something. So I come up with an idea - "Why don't I keep those all on a personal page?". And here it is, a place for me to store and implement the technologies I have perceived on my career path.

:::note

All of the docs are intended for my quick reference, so all of them are neither well written nor English. You should ignore them.
