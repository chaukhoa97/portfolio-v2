- `<meta robots />`(line 16)

  - `noindex`: To not show this page in search results. Omitting `noindex` will indicate the page can be indexed and shown in search results.
    In a website, u might not want to index certain pages. Common use cases include settings pages, internal search pages, policies, and more.

  - `nofollow`: To not follow links on this page. Omitting this will allow robots to crawl and follow links on this page. Links found on other pages may enable crawling, so if link `A` appears in pages `X` and `Y`, and `X` has a nofollow robots tag, but `Y` doesn't, Google may decide to crawl the link.

- `meta googlebot`(line 17): Use this tag if you want to have a separate rule for Googlebot, and a general one for the rest of the search bots.

- `canonical`(line 21): Content của `example.com/products/phone` trùng với `example.com/phone` -> Chọn link này để Google ko crawl trùng

- Semantic: `section(A group of content, typically with a heading)`, `header, nav, main, footer, aside`, article, address, figure.
