## Set a high-level context first...

For example, when building a markdown editor in Next.js, we could write a comment like this

```jsx
/*
Create a basic markdown editor in Next.js with the following features:

- Create state for markdown with default text "type markdown here"
- A text area where users can write markdown
...
*/
```

## ...followed by more detailed instructions...

## ... and examples

### Zero-shot learning

This is like when you see a new toy you've never seen before, but you know what it is because it looks like other toys you've seen. For example, if you've seen many different kinds of stuffed animals, you might be able to recognize a new one even if you've never seen that exact one before. Similarly, a computer can learn to recognize new things by using what it knows about similar things to make educated guesses about the new thing.

### One-shot learning

This is like when you see a new toy for the first time, and your mom or dad tells you what it's called and what it does. After hearing about it just once, you remember what it is and can recognize it the next time you see it. A computer can learn to recognize new things in the same way by being shown just a few examples and learning from them.

### Few-shot learning

Few-shot learning is like learning to do something new by seeing only a few examples. For example, let's say you want to learn how to draw a cat, but you've only seen a few pictures of cats before. With few-shot learning, you can still learn how to draw a cat even if you haven't seen many cats before. It's like a magic power that helps you learn new things quickly, even if you don't have a lot of examples to learn from!
